### Guidelines for a Winning Project Description

Last Thursday at 11:00 AM

Your project description is your **first impression**. Make it count with these elements:

**1. Clear Problem Statement (2-3 sentences)**

Start by explaining what problem you're solving and why it matters.

Example: _"Trading on Kraken requires developers to manually handle WebSocket connections and orderbook state management. Our SDK abstracts this complexity, providing a production-ready client with automatic reconnection, state synchronization, and a clean async API."_

**2. What You Built (1 paragraph)**

Describe your solution concisely. What does it do? What makes it unique?

🚨 Apply your project to a single track.

**3. Key Features (Bullet points)**

List 4-6 core features that showcase your project's capabilities.

**4. Technical Highlights (1 paragraph)**

Showcase your engineering decisions:

*   Technology stack and why you chose it
*   Performance optimizations
*   Architecture decisions
*   Notable algorithms or data structures used

**5. How It Works (Brief overview)**

Explain the user/developer experience:

*   How to install/set up
*   Basic usage example
*   What the workflow looks like

**6. Demo & Documentation**

*   Link to live demo (if applicable)
*   Link to video walkthrough
*   Mention the quality of your documentation
*   Include screenshots or GIFs showing your project in action

**7. Future Enhancements (Optional)**

Show vision and understanding of production requirements:

*   Features you'd add with more time
*   Scalability considerations
*   Potential integrations

**What Makes a Winning Submission**

Judges will be looking for:

*   **Production Quality**
*   **Performance**
*   **Reusability**
*   **Completeness**
*   **Innovation**
*   **Track Alignment**

**Final Tips**

1.   Start with your GitHub README: A great README often serves as the foundation for your TAIKAI description
2.   **Show, don't just tell:** Include visuals, code snippets, and demo links
3.   **Proofread**: Typos and unclear writing hurt your credibility
4.   **Submit early**: Don't wait until the last minute (deadline: Dec 24)
5.   **Be specific:**Concrete metrics and examples beat vague claims
6.   **Highlight the "why":** Explain your technical decisions and trade-offs.

### Project Submission Guide

Last Tuesday at 5:00 PM

Follow these steps to successfully submit your project to the Kraken Forge Hackathon:

**Navigate to the Hackathon Page**

*   Go to the Kraken Forge hackathon page on TAIKAI
*   Click the"Submit a project"button

**Fill Out the Project Form**

Project Name

Choose a clear, descriptive name that reflects what your project does.

🎯 **Select Your Track (CRITICAL)**

This is essential for evaluation.Choose the track that best matches your project:

*   **Track #1 - SDK Client: For lightweight SDKs connecting to Kraken's WebSocket API**
*   **Track #2 - Orderbook Visualizer: For web-based orderbook visualization with time travel**
*   **Track #3 - Strategy Builder: For low-code drag-and-drop trading strategy tools**

⚠️ Selecting the correct track ensures your project is judged by the right criteria and compared with similar submissions.

**Project Description**

Write a comprehensive description of your project

**GitHub Repository (REQUIRED)**

*   Provide a link to your public GitHub repository
*   Ensure your code is well-organized and accessible
*   Include all necessary files for judges to review and test your submission

**Additional Links**

Add any supplementary links:

*   Live demo
*   Video walkthrough
*   Documentation site
*   Presentation deck

Double-check all information before submitting, especially your track selection and GitHub link.

🚨 **Publish your Project (CRITICAL)**

Don't forget to publish the project on TAIKAI before the Submission Deadline on 24th December 2025 17:00 UTC. You can publish before the deadline. Your project details are only available to the organization teams, no one from the other teams can see your submission.

**Good luck, and build something incredible! 🐙**

### Quick Reminders

11/12/2025 - 08:30

Hey everyone! Hope the building phase is going smoothly and you’re enjoying diving into your projects 🐙⚙️

Just a quick reminder that **all projects must be submitted individually**. This is a solo hackathon, so no team submissions or shared projects across multiple participants. Each participant should submit their own work.

Also, **make sure you stick to the preferred tech stack listed for your selected track.** Those choices are part of the expectations for the challenge and will be taken into account during the review. Using a different stack may affect the evaluation!

If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to drop a message here or DM us. Keep building, and good luck!

Hello everyone 👋,

The building stage of the Kraken Forge Hackathon is officially underway! 🚀 This is the moment to turn your ideas into real code and create something that truly showcases your skills and potential.

1️⃣ Stay motivated

This stage is where your creativity, skills, and teamwork really shine. Whether you’re experimenting with a new approach, solving tricky technical problems, or polishing your prototype, every bit of effort counts. Remember, this is not just a competition, it’s a chance to showcase your talent and build something that could be used beyond the hackathon.

2️⃣ Next steps & deadlines

To keep everything on track:

*   Start building now:focus on your chosen track and organize your team’s workflow.
*   Submission deadline: projects may be submitted anytime before the deadline. The final cutoff for all submissions is Dec 24. Make sure your repo, functional prototype, and demo video are ready by then.
*   Stay on track:plan your work, iterate on your idea, and make steady progress throughout the building phase.

3️⃣ Choose your challenge

You can focus on any of the three tracks:

*   SDK Client: Build a lightweight SDK that connects to Kraken’s WebSocket API and provides a clean, reusable interface for developers. **Tech: C++ or Rust**
*   Orderbook Visualizer: Create a web-based tool to visualize the order book in real time, including historical “time travel” functionality. **Tech: React or Rust/C++ GUI**
*   Strategy Builder:Develop a low-code, drag-and-drop interface for building trading strategies, making it easy for users to place and cancel orders.**Tech: React**

Each track is designed to challenge your skills, encourage creativity, and reward solutions that are reusable and well-documented. Pick the one that excites you most and start building!
